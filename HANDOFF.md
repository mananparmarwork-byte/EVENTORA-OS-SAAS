# Eventora OS — Handoff Notes

Written: 19 Oct 2026. Use this file to continue the build in a new Claude session (or any account).

## 1. What this project is
A full rebuild of the "Swagattam Event Estimator" (event / banquet quotation, booking and payment tool) as **Eventora OS**.
All Swagattam names and logos are removed. Same features as the base file, new structure, new UI, real PDF bills.
Stack: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + wouter (hash routing) + TanStack Query + Supabase + @react-pdf/renderer + qrcode.

## 2. HONEST STATUS — written but NOT yet run
The build session had **no access to the npm registry**, so `npm install`, `npm run build` and the app itself were **never run**.
I only type-checked the code against stubbed library types (no real errors found in my own code, but that is not a real build).
Expect a handful of small compile or runtime fixes on the first real build.

Rough progress: **~90% of the code is written (everything planned is now built), ~0% verified.** What is left is mainly: build, test, fix, your PDF layout, and your extra changes.

## 3. What is DONE (all files exist in this zip)
| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| Theme (your Midnight Luxury palette as Tailwind tokens) | `src/index.css` |
| Data model, pricing engine (discount → GST → advance), booking/time logic, INR + amount-in-words | `src/lib/types.ts, pricing.ts, booking.ts, format.ts, catalog.ts, settings.ts, stats.ts, qr.ts` |
| Database adapter (Supabase, or Hostinger API) — demo mode was removed, the app needs a real database | `src/lib/backend.ts`, `src/lib/api.ts` |
| Supabase setup (tables, RLS, booked_times function) | `supabase/setup.sql`, `supabase/make-admin.sql` |
| **Hostinger backend** — PHP 8 REST API + MySQL schema + one-time admin script (selected automatically when `VITE_API_URL` is set) | `hostinger-api/index.php, schema.sql, config.sample.php, create-admin.php, .htaccess` and `makeHttpBackend` in `src/lib/backend.ts` |
| Business logo upload (printed on PDFs) | Settings page, `BillDocument.tsx` |
| GitHub Pages deploy | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` |
| App shell: collapsible sidebar (248px / 76px), mobile drawer, login | `src/App.tsx, layouts/AdminLayout.tsx, pages/Login.tsx` |
| Dashboard Overview (greeting, KPI cards + sparklines, revenue chart, activity feed, upcoming events, quick actions) | `src/pages/admin/Overview.tsx` |
| Estimator (event details, date + from/till time with clash detection, catalog tabs, discount, GST, advance, live summary, save/edit, WhatsApp, copy) | `src/pages/Estimator.tsx, components/DatePicker.tsx, MonthGrid.tsx` |
| Quotations list + bill detail + payments (cash/UPI/bank, UPI QR, WhatsApp request, payment history, mark booked with clash check) | `src/pages/admin/Quotes.tsx, components/PaymentPanel.tsx` |
| Calendar, Catalog editor, Reports (PDF + CSV), Settings (business profile, payments, system) | `src/pages/admin/CalendarPage.tsx, CatalogPage.tsx, Reports.tsx, SettingsPage.tsx` |
| PDFs: Quotation / Tax Invoice (header band, parties, itemised by category, CGST/SGST, amount in words, payment QR + bank, terms, signature, page numbers) and monthly Report | `src/pdf/BillDocument.tsx, ReportDocument.tsx, generate.tsx` |

Original features covered: customer estimator, catalog/menu editor, saved quotes, edit saved bill, discount, GST + GSTIN toggles,
multi-date booking with time ranges and double-booking prevention, occupancy calendar, advance/payments, UPI QR + WhatsApp, printable PDFs, enquiry reports, admin login.

## 4. What REMAINS (in order)
1. **First real build** — on a machine with internet (or Replit): `npm install` then `npm run build`. Fix any compile errors.
   Likely spots: `src/pdf/*` (react-pdf typings), `wouter` hash import (`wouter/use-hash-location`), Tailwind class names.
2. **Run it** (`npm run dev`) with your Supabase keys in `.env` (without them the app shows a "Connect your database" screen). Click through every page on desktop and phone width.
3. **Generate a PDF** (Settings → Business → Preview sample PDF, and from a bill) and check the layout.
4. **PDF layout** — you said you will supply your own layout later. The whole layout is isolated in `src/pdf/BillDocument.tsx` (+ `ReportDocument.tsx`). Replace those two files; nothing else changes.
   Money is written "INR 1,25,000.00" because built-in PDF fonts have no ₹ glyph. To use ₹, register a TTF font that contains it.
5. **Supabase test** — create a project, run `supabase/setup.sql`, add a user, run `make-admin.sql` with that email, set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (copy `.env.example` to `.env`; for GitHub add them as Actions *variables*), push to GitHub, Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions.
6. **Hostinger (production)** — the code is written, never run. Steps:
   1. hPanel → Databases → create a MySQL database + user. Open phpMyAdmin → Import `hostinger-api/schema.sql`.
   2. Copy `hostinger-api/config.sample.php` to `config.php`, fill in DB details, your domain in `allowed_origins`, and a long random `setup_key`.
   3. Upload the `hostinger-api/` folder to `public_html/api/` (File Manager).
   4. Open `https://yourdomain.com/api/create-admin.php?key=SETUP_KEY&email=you@x.com&password=StrongPass123`, then **delete create-admin.php**.
   5. Build the site with `VITE_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api/index.php` (put it in `.env`), run `npm run build`, upload everything inside `dist/` to `public_html/`. Hash URLs (`/#/admin`) need no rewrite rules.
   6. Test: login, create a quote, mark booked, record a payment, download PDF. (Check PHP version is 8.0+ and the `json` MySQL type is available — MySQL 5.7+/MariaDB 10.2+.)
   Supabase vs Hostinger is chosen only by env vars: `VITE_API_URL` set → Hostinger; else Supabase keys → Supabase; neither → setup screen.
7. **Your other changes** — you said you would provide a list later (buttons to move/add, extra features).
8. **Polish / hardening** — the public estimator lets anyone insert quotes (same as the original); decide if that should be admin-only. Add real logo upload if wanted. Final accessibility and mobile pass.

## 5. Things you should know
- `_unused_earlier_files/` holds 7 files I did **not** write that appeared in the project folder (an earlier, different attempt). They conflict with the current code, so I moved them out of `src/`. Safe to delete after a glance.
- No demo mode: the app starts empty and needs a real database (Supabase or the Hostinger API). `SETUP-GITHUB-SUPABASE.md` has the click-by-click setup.
- Bill numbers auto-suggest as `EV-1009` etc. for admins; must be unique.
- Colours are the exact tokens from your Midnight Luxury theme (see `src/index.css`).

## 6. Starter prompt for the next session
Upload this zip, then paste:

> This is "Eventora OS", a rebuild of an event/banquet quotation + booking platform. Read `HANDOFF.md` first. The code is written but has never been built or run. Please: (1) run `npm install` and `npm run build` and fix every error, (2) run the dev server, screenshot each page at desktop and phone width and fix visual bugs, (3) generate the sample PDF and check it. Keep the Midnight Luxury colours in `src/index.css`. Do not change the `Backend` interface in `src/lib/backend.ts`. I will then give you my PDF layout and a list of extra changes.

## 7. Review pass (19 Oct) — fixed before handing over
- Date picker was wrapped in a `<label>` (clicks would have toggled it open/closed) → wrapper is now a `div`.
- Settings could re-render forever if the settings load failed → stable default objects.
- PDF table header marked `fixed` would print over the page-1 banner → removed.
- Public estimator save on Supabase would fail (anonymous users cannot read rows back) → insert no longer asks for the row back.
- Hostinger: added `.htaccess` rule so PHP receives the login token.
- Login now refreshes the session before opening the dashboard.
- `npm run build` no longer stops on type errors (run `npm run typecheck` separately to list them).
Still unverified by a real build: see section 2.

## 8. Update v2 (20 Oct 2026)
See `UPGRADE-v2.md`. New: report period picker, full activity log + auto-delete, owner/employee roles with permissions, per-day bill numbers (`EV-DDMMYY-1001`), round clock time picker.
New/changed files: `src/lib/range.ts, activity.ts, useFeed.ts, stats.ts, api.ts, backend.ts, types.ts`; `src/components/TimePicker.tsx, RangePicker.tsx, ActivityList.tsx, DatePicker.tsx, PaymentPanel.tsx`;
`src/pages/admin/ActivityPage.tsx, SettingsExtra.tsx, Overview.tsx, Reports.tsx, Quotes.tsx, CalendarPage.tsx, SettingsPage.tsx`; `src/pages/Estimator.tsx, Login.tsx`; `src/layouts/AdminLayout.tsx`; `src/App.tsx`;
`supabase/setup.sql, add-employee.sql`; `hostinger-api/index.php, schema.sql, upgrade-v2.sql`.
The `Backend` interface was extended (not broken): createQuote(input, overrideRef), peekBillNumber, setNextBillNumber, logActivity, listActivity, purgeActivity, staff methods; Session now has a `role`.

## 9. SaaS build (20 Oct 2026)
See `SAAS-SETUP.md`. New SQL `supabase/05-07*.sql`, edge functions in `supabase/functions/`, pages Landing / Signup / BillingPage / PlatformPage, `src/lib/plans.ts`, tenant-aware `backend.ts` (catalog/settings/calendar/bills go through database functions), roles now come from `members` table (`admin_users` / `staff_users` are legacy).

## 10. Billing build (21 Oct 2026)
SQL `08-saas-billing.sql` (plans, coupons, trial length, autopay flag, reminders, payment history), `09-reminder-cron.sql`, `10-billing-check.sql`; edge functions `create-checkout` (autopay + coupons, auto-creates Razorpay plans), `manage-subscription` (cancel autopay), `razorpay-webhook`, `send-reminders`. App: BillingPage (coupons, autopay), PlatformPage tabs (Businesses / Plans / Coupons / Free trial) in `PlatformExtra.tsx`, hard lock in `AdminLayout`. See `SAAS-SETUP.md`.

## 11. Merge with the "eventria" upload (22 Oct 2026)
Ported into the SaaS build: login-only app (public customer estimator removed), employees can never delete bills, `created_by` + "See bills made by others", TOTP two-step verification (`_aal_ok()` gate in `my_tenant/is_admin/is_staff`), AccountPage (password, 2-step, sign out everywhere), `manage-staff` Edge Function (create/delete/reset, same-business only; replaces create-employee), 10-char passwords, 30-min idle sign-out, 5-wrong-password pause, stricter `create_quote`, `customer_gst_number` column. SQL `11-saas-security-team.sql` (+ `12-security-check.sql`) must run last. See `SAAS-SETUP.md`.
